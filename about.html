                    I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science because I like problem solving and coming up with
                    solutions. I like the complexity of computers and the code, spending hours on fixing one simple bug.
                    Programming
                    really challenges me to think outside the box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to come up with an
                    innovative idea that helps everyone and makes their lives easier.

                My hobbies:
                <ul>
                    <li>I am the president of the League of Legends Club at Stony Brook University</li>
                    <li>Drawing from time to time, editing videos, arts and crafts</li>
                    <li>I love cooking Chinese cuisine, reading and playing video games</li>
                </ul>Fun fact: My parents speak Chinese Mandarin, and I lived my childhood in Mexico, so I speak three
                languages fluently!
